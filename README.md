# Random Quote Machine
This was a FreeCodeCamp project to create a page that displays random quotes with the option to tweet them.

This project was completed on CodePen and can be viewed [here](https://codepen.io/jdsandifer/full/BJpZEw/).

The code is copied to GitHub for easier viewing by type (html, scss, javascript).
