# Random Quote Machine
This was a FreeCodeCamp project to create a page that displays random quotes with an option to tweet them.
I chose to use quotes about design (QuotesOnDesign.com) because I like improving my design skills and this
would be a way to do that as part of my programming work. (I also went through different revisions on the design
of the look of the project, too.

I completed this project on CodePen and you can see it in action [here](https://codepen.io/jdsandifer/full/pQMxGY).

I copied the code to GitHub for easier access and viewing.
