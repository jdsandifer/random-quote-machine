# Random Quote Machine
This was a FreeCodeCamp project to create a page that displays random quotes with an option to tweet them.
I chose to use quotes about design (QuotesOnDesign.com) because I like improving my design sensibilities.

I completed this project on CodePen and you can see it in action [here](https://codepen.io/jdsandifer/full/pQMxGY).

I copied the code to GitHub for easier access and viewing.
