# Random Quote Machine
This was a FreeCodeCamp project to create a page that displays random quotes with an option to tweet them.
I chose to use quotes about design (QuotesOnDesign.com) because I like improving my design sensibilities.

In fact, while testing this project, I often found myself reading the quotes and accessing more of them than necessary
to find the next bug or confirm that everything was working correctly. That slowed down my testing a little, but I'm 
glad I picked something that I fould so enjoyable!

I completed this project on CodePen and you can see it in action here: [Random Quote Machine](https://codepen.io/jdsandifer/full/pQMxGY).

I copied the code to GitHub for easier access and viewing: [HTML](https://github.com/jdsandifer/random-quote-machine/blob/master/src/main.html), [JavaScript](https://github.com/jdsandifer/random-quote-machine/blob/master/src/main.js), and [Sass](https://github.com/jdsandifer/random-quote-machine/blob/master/src/main.scss).
